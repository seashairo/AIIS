# AIS
Repository for advanced information systems.

This was a project to attempt to detect people in a video using basic machine learning techniques. It was worked on over the course of several weeks (really most of the work was done in 3 solid days) by 3 people.

The end result is quite good at detecting trees, poles, and other vertical objects, but has trouble with people for the most part.

There are no instructions to run this since it was last worked on, and submitted, in 2016. 

This README is being added as I fork it to ensure I have a copy of past work (something I've been terrible at doing to this point).
